# ‚ö° IEEE123 Power Flow Simulator

This Python script performs hourly power flow simulations on the IEEE 123 Bus distribution system using OpenDSS via the `py_dss_interface`. It evaluates voltage profiles, PV generation impacts, and feeder-level power flows over a 24-hour period based on input load shapes.

## üîç Overview

This simulator:
- Loads a DSS master file for the IEEE 123 Bus system
- Uses real-world load shape curves for hourly simulation
- Performs power flow analysis for each hour (1‚Äì24)
- Detects voltage violations (overvoltage, undervoltage)
- Tracks feeder power flows, PV contributions, and system losses

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ‚úÖ **24-Hour Simulation Loop**  
  Runs a complete daily simulation by hour

- ‚òÄÔ∏è **PV Integration Assessment**  
  Simulates the effect of 100% non-programmable PV at a selected location

- üìä **Result Storage with Pandas**  
  All hourly metrics are compiled into a DataFrame for further analysis

- üí° **Voltage and Power Metrics**  
  Captures max/min voltages, PV power, total feeder flow, and losses

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Execution Time Tracking**  
  Reports the total simulation time in minutes
